* Ideas for Shan

- [-] manage system packages
  - [-] install/remove packages
    - [ ] Thing should be /ordered/ to ensure dependencies are met.
      - ~shan install npm -npm underscore~ shouldn't fail because npm tries to go first.
    - [ ] Should be able to list packages in flag-style format like above
    - [-] Support for lots of package managers. It would be cool to be able to support:
      - [X] yay
      - [X] paru
      - [X] pacman
      - [ ] apt
      - [ ] brew
      - [ ] mac ports
      - [ ] rpm
      - [ ] yum
      - [ ] dnf
      - [ ] snap
      - [ ] app image
      - [ ] flatpak
      - [ ] scoop
      - [ ] choco
      - [ ] winget
      - [X] npm
      - [ ] yarn
      - [X] pip
      - [ ] conda
      - [X] gem
      - [ ] gu
      - [ ] raco
      - [ ] dotnet
  - [ ] add/remove package archives
    - [ ] Learn how package archives /work/ a little bit before jumping into this. I'm trying to
      implement something I don't really know about.
  - [X] list all packages
    - [X] support listing packages in various formats
      - [X] parseable
      - [X] json
      - [X] edn
      - [X] human
  - [ ] search for packages
    - [ ] Display package info from package manager it belongs to
      - [ ] This is really slow right now because finding out which package manager a package
        belongs to is slow. Some caching could do good here.
  - [ ] merging/purging temporary packages
  - [X] importing packages to start using shan
  - [ ] support adding different mirrors for certain package managers. Ex. Manjaro uses a different
    AUR mirror than Arch Linux.
    - [ ] update mirrors without updating packages
- [ ] manager dotfiles
  - [ ] symlink dotfiles from one place to another
- [ ] install software not in package managers
  - [ ] run system commands
  - [ ] run scripts
